<h1>What is this Project?</h1>
<p>This project aims to develop a teaching platform dedicated to computer science and the development of websites and software. Completely free, its mission is to provide a comprehensive and gap-free study for new programmers. We will seek to improve user interactivity on the platform, ensuring that they do not feel isolated and that they receive support for any questions related to both learning and using the platform.
</p>
<p>In order to promote user learning and interaction, all of the platform's code will be available in a public repository. This initiative aims to motivate beginners to start their own projects, in addition to serving as a gateway for them to contribute to the development of the platform. This collaboration will provide newcomers with the opportunity to expand their knowledge and experience in development, as well as other key areas for a developer.</p>

<h1>PROGRESS OF THE PROJECT</h1>
<P>We are currently in the development phase of the user registration and login system, which will have complete integration with the MySQL database. We highlight that security is a priority and, therefore, the system algorithm will have several rigorous checks of user input data. Additionally, when inserted into the database, user passwords will go through an encryption process, aiming to prevent any possible hacking of user accounts. This additional care is crucial to guarantee the protection and privacy of our users' data. It is worth noting that the data about the database contained in this code is for testing purposes only and will not be data from the platform's main database.</P>
